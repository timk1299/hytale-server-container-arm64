# Support

## Debug Mode

If you are experiencing issues with your installation, I have included an automated diagnostic script that audits your **network configurations** and **security settings** during the container startup.

### How to Enable Diagnostics

- Enable the environment variable DEBUG and set it to "TRUE". The DEBUG mode will run some automated tests that come with the Docker Hytale server container image.
