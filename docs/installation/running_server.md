# Running the Container

We are now going to start the server!

1. **Authenticate the `hytale-downloader` CLI tool**

    The terminal will automatically display two links: a verification URL and a direct link with the code already attached. Open the website in your browser using the second link with the code attached. Log in to your Hytale account to authenticate. The script automatically downloads the server files if you do not already have them installed.

2. **Downloading, installing and running the server**

    Please be patient; the server is downloading and extracting the necessary files. You will not see any progress on the screen. After that, it will start the server. This can take a while depending on your internet connection speed and hardware.

3. **Authenticate the server** 

    After the server boots, the terminal will automatically display two links again. Open the website in your browser using the second link with the code attached, and log in to authenticate your server instance.

4. **Done!**

> If you want to run commands in the hytale server directly from the console. You can use `docker attach CONTAINER_NAME` to attach to the server console.
